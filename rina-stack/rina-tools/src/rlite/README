====== Example applications using the RINA API  ======

This directory contains example programs written using the RINA POSIX-like
API (available in the following file of the IRATI repository:
librina/wrap/rina-api/include/rina/api.h).
People willing to write native RINA applications or to port existing socket
application to RINA can take these programs as reference examples for the
API usage.

The source files contained here are a copy of the original ones available
in the rlite project repository (https://github.com/vmaffione/rlite), and
they are stored in this directory only to ease the build process.
Future updates to the original sources could (and should) be reflected here.
